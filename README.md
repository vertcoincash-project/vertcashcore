[![NPM Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vertcore.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/vertcore)
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/vertcoin-project/vertcore.svg?branch=master&style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/vertcoin-project/vertcore)

Infrastructure to build Vertcoin Cash and blockchain-based applications for the next generation of financial technology.

**Note:** If you're looking for the Vertcore Library please see: https://github.com/vertcoin-project/vertcore-lib

## Getting Started

Before you begin you'll need to have Node.js v8 installed. There are several options for installation. One method is to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to easily switch between different versions, or download directly from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

```bash
npm install -g vertcoin-project/vertcore
```

Spin up a full node and join the network:

```bash
npm install -g vertcoin-project/vertcore
vertcored
```

You can then view the Insight block explorer at the default location: `http://localhost:3001/insight`, and your configuration file will be found in your home directory at `~/.vertcore`.

Create a transaction:
```js
var vertcore = require('vertcore');
var transaction = new vertcore.Transaction();
var transaction.from(unspent).to(address, amount);
transaction.sign(privateKey);
```
